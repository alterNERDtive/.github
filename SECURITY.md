# Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

Please reach out via [Discord](https://discord.alternerd.tv) (alternerdtive) if you encounter security vulnerabilities instead of filing a publicly accessible issue.

All reported vulnerabilities will be credited in the commit message and release notes as soon as they are fixed.
